title: "About Me"
---


Hello! I'm Magpie Winslow, a master's student and researcher at [UBC Okanagan](https://ok.ubc.ca). Most of my work attempts to describe the mind using the [[Math as Language |language of quantum mechanics]]. Specifically, I'm attempting to understand how our environment, emotions, and past thoughts shape our thought processes. 

You can typically find me on campus in ART 367, or you can reach me at [mwinslow@mail.ubc.ca](mailto:mwinslow@mail.ubc.ca)
