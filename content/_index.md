Welcome to my neck of the woods! Hope you get to relax a little.

I'm Magpie Winslow, a master's student and researcher at [UBC Okanagan](https://ok.ubc.ca). Most of my work attempts to describe the mind using the language of quantum mechanics.

For more of me in a professional context, head to my [[Professional/About Me]] page.

Otherwise, feel free to explore. 
- Over here are my [works in progress](/new_growth). 
	- If you want to see what I'm thinking about.
- This way leads to my [personal instruction manuals](/how_to)
	- Because we all forget things from time to time.
- And these are some [teaching notes](/Teaching&Learning) for those that are curious!
