Welcome to my neck of the woods! Hope you get to relax a little.

I'm [[Professional/About Me| Magpie Winslow]], and this is my open research notebook and digital garden. Head to my [[Professional/About Me]] page to learn more about who I am and what I do!

Otherwise, feel free to explore. 
- Over here are my [works in progress](/new_growth). 
	- If you want to see what I'm thinking about.
- This way leads to my [personal instruction manuals](/how_to)
	- Because we all forget things from time to time.
- And these are some [teaching notes](/Teaching&Learning) for those that are curious!
