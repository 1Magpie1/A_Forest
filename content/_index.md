Welcome to my neck of the woods! I hope you get to relax a little.

I'm [[Professional/About Me|Magpie Winslow]], and this is my [[notes/Open Research Notebook]] and [[notes/Digital Garden]]. Head to my [[Professional/About Me]] page to learn more about who I am and what I do!

Otherwise, feel free to explore. 
- Over here are my [works in progress](/new_growth). 
	- If you want to see what I'm thinking about.
- This way leads to my [personal instruction manuals](/how_to)
	- Because we all forget things from time to time.
- And these are some [teaching notes](/Teaching&Learning) for those that are curious!

As much of this website is me [working in public](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Work_with_the_garage_door_up), there will be incomplete and partially formed ideas here. The following tags should help clarify the goal of the page:
- #Guide
	- This is my current understanding of how to do a given task.
- #Question
	- The beginnings of an idea which needs to be researched and developed.
- #Idea
	- Something I am currently investigating but do not have a firm grasp on.
- #Discussion
	- Personal thoughts and opinions on a topic. 
- #Claim
	- An idea I am confident I can support but requires fine-tuning. 
- #Results
	- An idea which is supported by research and outside sources. 
- #Procedure
	- An explanation of experimental methods
- #Published
	- This has been published in peer-reviewed literature. 

You can also see how developed each thought or idea is with these tags:
- #Sprouting
	- I am beginning to develop this
- #Growing
	- I am actively working on this
- #Standing
	- Mostly developed but not actively in use
- #Roaming
	- Mostly developed and actively in use
- #Dead
	- I no longer believe this to be true. There should be a link and an explanation for why it is false.
- #Stone
	- This is a record of past work and/or events that have happened.

I hope this helps you find your way! Good luck!
