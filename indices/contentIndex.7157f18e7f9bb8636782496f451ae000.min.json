Make sure you have the package `brms` installed and loaded. This walkthrough also uses the `tidyverse` package, which is not strictly necessary. \n\n```{r}\ninstall.packages(\"brms\") # this is a fairly large package and may take some time to download.\ninstall.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\nlibrary(\"brms\")\nlibrary(\"tidyverse\")\n```\n\nNext, we need to load our data. I simulated this data based on the following design. The data can be found at [this link].\n\n\u003e In the first part of this study, 20 people (referred to as Senders) were videotaped, making one true statement and one false statement. This resulted in 20 videos of true statements and 20 videos of lies. Each Sender filled out a survey on their interpersonal warmth. \n\u003e \n\u003e In the second part, participants were asked to watch six videos from the last part of the study. Unbeknownst to the participant, half were lies, and half were true statements. After each video, the participants rate how much they want to spend time with the Sender. After watching all six videos, participants filled out an emotional intelligence questionnaire. \n\u003e\n\u003e Likability, warmth, and emotional intelligence are measured on a scale of 1 - 7 (midpoint at 4.)\n\n```{r}\nLie.Data \u003c- read_csv(\"\")\nhead(Lie.Data)\n```\n\n## Analysis Map\n\nBefore we start, let's set up a plan for the analysis. We will run five analyses to understand the impact of different variables and different types of analysis. \n\n- Model 1: `Likability ~ Message`\n\t- Effectively a t-test to see if there is a difference between true statements and lies.\n- Model 2: `Likability ~ Sender.Warmth*Participant.EI + Message`\n\t- Standard linear regression model.\n- Model 3: `Likability ~ Message + (1|Sender.ID) + (1|Participant.ID) `\n\t- Incorporating random effects into our first model.\n- Model 4: ` Likability ~ Sender.Warmth*Participant.EI + Message + (1|Sender.ID) + (1|Participant.ID)`\n\t- Model 2 with Random effects. \n\n## Priors\n\nBefore we set our priors, we should check the defaults. Ultimately we want to build up to a linear mixed effects model so that we will look at the defaults for that model. To see what the priors are for a model, we can use `get_prior`\n\n```{r}\nget_prior(Likeability ~ Sender.Warmth*Participant.EI + Message + (1|Sender.ID) + (1|Participant.ID), data = Lie.Data, family = gaussian)\n```\n\nThe first part of this function is the model we would like to test. Here we are seeing if the warmth of the sender, the participant's emotional intelligence and the type of message predict the perceived likability of the senders, letting individual differences of senders and participants be random effects. \n\n\u003e*The final argument `family = gaussian` tells the function what type of data we expect for `Likeability`. If your DV is a continuous measure (i.e. you are dealing with anything related to linear regression), then you do not need the argument. Refer to more advanced statistical guides if you use dichotomous or count data as your DV.* \n\nThe output of this command is a table with no legend. The primary columns we are concerned with are `prior`, `class`, `coef`, and `group`. \n- The `prior` column states the default prior for that variable. For a fixed effect variable, that will typically be a flat, uninformative distribution.\n- `class` tells you if you are dealing with a fixed or random effect variable. Fixed effects are class `b`, while random effects are class `sd`. Random effects are denoted `sd` because the prior describes the distribution of standard deviations for that variable. \n\t- You will also notice classes `intercept` and `sigma`. `intercept` is what you expect, while `sigma` is the random error not described by the model.\n- `coef` and `group` are the names `R` will assign to each variable. \n\nThis table allows us to determine the classes and names required to set our priors.\n\nWe will assign our priors now to make our code more readable. \n\nFor our priors, let's say that the average difference between the effect of lies and factual statements on likability is .5 with a standard deviation of 2. We will set the mean for warmth and emotional intelligence at 0 with a variance of 1. We won't touch any other variables. \n\u003e I very much pulled these values at random. It would be best if you based them on the results of previous research. \n\n```{r}\nModel1.Prior \u003c- set_prior(\"normal(.5,2)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"MessageT\")\n\nModel2.Priors \u003c- c(\n\tset_prior(\"normal(.5,2)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"MessageT\"),\n\tset_prior(\"normal(0,1)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"Sender.Warmth\"),\n\tset_prior(\"normal(0,1)\", class = \"b\", coef = \"Sender.Warmth\")\n)\n\n```\n\n## Analysis\n\nNow for arguably the most straightforward step, running the models! \n\n```\nModel1 \u003c- brm(\n\tLikeabiliy ~ Message,\n\tdata = Lie.Data,\n\tprior = Model1.Prior,\n\tsave_pars = save_pars(all = T),\n\titer = 8000,\n\twarmup = 2000\n)\n\nModel2 \u003c- brm(\n\tLikability ~ Sender.Warmth*Participant.EI + Message,\n\tdata = Lie.Data,\n\tprior = Model2.Priors,\n\tsave_pars = save_pars(all = T),\n\titer = 8000,\n\twarmup = 2000\n)\n\nModel3 \u003c- brm(\n\tLikability ~ Message + (1|Sender.ID) + (1|Participant.ID),\n\tdata = Lie.Data,\n\tprior = Model1.Prior,\n\tsave_pars = save_pars(all = T),\n\titer = 8000,\n\twarmup = 2000\n)\n\nModel4 \u003c- brm(\n\tLikability ~ Sender.Warmth*Participant.EI + Message + (1|Sender.ID) + (1|Participant.ID),\n\tdata = Lie.Data,\n\tprior = Model2.Priors,\n\tsave_pars = save_pars(all = T),\n\titer = 8000,\n\twarmup = 2000\n)\n\n```\n\nNow, to understand what is happening here, let's break down `Model1`. The first three lines tell the function how we would like to model our data, the data we are using, and the priors we chose. The fourth line states that we want to save all the parameters generated by the model. The fifth and sixth lines relate to how Bayesian methods calculate parameter values. These last three lines allow us to calculate the Bayes factor later on. \n\u003eOne of the downsides of this package is that it will take a while to run, with more complicated models taking significantly longer. As such, `Model4` may take a few minutes to run. To speed things up, delete each model's fourth and fifth lines.\n\nOnce we have run the above code, we can use `summary()` to see the results.\n\n## Hypothesis Testing\n\nThere are two easy ways to test hypotheses in `brms`: `hypothesis()` and `bayes_factor()`\n\n### hypothesis()\n\nThis function allows you to test different hypotheses about relationships between variables *within a model*.\n\nFor instance, we can test if lying impacted how likable a person was in `Model3`\n\n```{r}\nhypothesis(Model3, \"MessageT = Intercept\")\n\n```\n\nThis will test if there is a significant difference between the baseline (the impact of lies on likability in this case) and the variable `MessageT` (the effect of true statements on likability) with 95% certainty. \n\n### bayes_factor()\n\nThis function allows you to see if there is a difference *between models* and, if so, which model has more support.\n\nFor instance, we can test if adding emotional intelligence and warmth to the model made a difference.\n\n```\nbayes_factor(Model1, Model2)\n\n```\n\nThis will tell us the degree to which the data favours `Model1` over `Model2`.\n\nOr, we could see if mixed effects models are helpful in this case.\n\n```\nbayes_factor(Model2,Model4)\n\n```","lastmodified":"2023-03-29T20:43:59.345903652Z","tags":null},"/how_to/Mass-Email":{"title":"Group Emails","content":"\nThis is a quick tutorial on using Word, Excel, and Outlook to send emails to groups of people!\n\nThis procedure will send out individual emails to each person on your list. \n\n\u003e This means recipients can only respond to you, and no one else in the email list will see their response, even if the person hits \"Reply All.\"\n\n\nGood luck! If you need help, there are many resources online that can help!\n\n## Requirements\n\nHave Word, Excel, and Outlook installed\n\nMake sure Outlook is your default email app\n\n## Set up\n\nYou will need a spreadsheet with all the people you want to email, their email addresses, and any information you may need to make subgroups. \n\n| First_Name | Last_Name | Email Address            | Job          |\n| ---------- | --------- | ------------------------ | ------------ |\n| Jane       | Doe       | JaneDoe@example.email    | Mathematician |\n| Jack       | Frost     | FrostyJack@example.email | Artist             |\n\nMake sure it is clean with separate columns for name, email, and subgroup. \n\n\u003e I recommend having people fill out the subgroup component as a forced-choice question to ensure consistent spelling and vocabulary. This will help out later.\n\n## Writing and Formatting the Email\n\nThis component is relatively simple, draft the email in Word. If you want to include personal information (i.e. Names), leave that area blank.\n\nNext, click \"Mailings.\" In the ribbon, click \"Start Mail Merge\" $\\rightarrow$ \"Email Message.\" This formats the document as an email and prepares Word for the next steps.\n\nTo tell it where to find the email database, click \"Select Recipients\" $\\rightarrow$ \"Use an Existing List.\" This will open a dialogue box where you can select the excel document from **Set up**. \n\n\u003eYou will receive a dialogue asking if you trust the author of the excel document. This is an extra security measure. If you made the document, you do not have to worry. Click \"Yes\" to continue.\n\nIn the \"Open Workbook\" dialogue, you can select the specific sheet of the email lists. Leave the \"Cell Range\" option blank and click \"OK.\"\n\n### Optional \n\n1) Adding in people's names\nIf you want to include personal information from the excel document (i.e. people's names):\n- Click so that your cursor is at the point where you want to insert the information into the email.\n- Click \"Insert Merge Field\" and select the column with the information you want to insert\n- To see how the final email will look when sent, use the \"Preview Results\" button to see what different recipients will receive.\n\n2) Sending to only some participants\nIf you want to send only to a subset of your email group:\n- Click \"Filter Recipients\" \n- In \"Field,\" click the drop-down menu and select the column in your excel file with the information you want to use to subset your list.\n- Use the \"Equal to\" option in the \"Comparison\" column and the group name in the \"Compare to\" column to select that specific group. \n\t-  Use the \"Not equal to\" option in the \"Comparison\" column to choose a group to exclude.\n\n## Sending Email\n\nTo send the email, click \"Finish \u0026 Merge\" $\\rightarrow$ \"Merge to Email.\"\n\nAfter hitting \"Merge to Email,\" you will receive the \"Mail Recipient\" dialogue box. \n- In the \"To\" field, select the column of the data sheet with people's emails.  \n- In the \"Subject\" field, write out the email's subject line.\n- In the \"Send As\" field, it is recommended that you use the \"HTML\" option. \n\nFinally, click \"Mail Merge To Outbox.\" This will open Outlook, asking if you want to send the email. Click \"Yes,\" and your email has been sent off!
